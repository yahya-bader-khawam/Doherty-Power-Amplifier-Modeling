# Doherty Power Amplifiers Modeling Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and BiLSTM models


* The power amplifier (PA) is a major device included in a transceiver system. Its performance significantly impacts the quality of the transmitted signal and that of the communication link. Modern PAs are driven by signals having various schemes such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). With such advanced schemes, the static and memory effects of the PA should be included in the modeling and linearization processes. The motivation behind the proposed models is to accurately predict static nonlinearities of the amplifier. Here is an illustration of modeling Doherty Power Amplifier using deep neural networks. Both of the graphs show the measured and modeled polar domain (AM-AM and AM-PM) of the DUT.
